Weather Data Table:

Each weather record is stored with columns for station ID, date, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation.
Uniqueness is ensured by enforcing a composite UNIQUE constraint on station_id and date.
Missing values are represented as NULL or equivalent values (such as -9999 for missing weather readings).


Weather Statistics Table:

A separate table is created to store calculated yearly statistics for each station.
This approach avoids redundant calculations during queries and helps optimize performance.
The statistics include the average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, and total accumulated precipitation for each station and year.


Queries used to create table - 
CREATE TABLE weather_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    max_temp INT,       -- Maximum temperature in tenths of Celsius
    min_temp INT,       -- Minimum temperature in tenths of Celsius
    precipitation INT,  -- Precipitation in tenths of millimeters
    UNIQUE(station_id, date)
);

CREATE TABLE weather_stats (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    station_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    year INT NOT NULL,
    avg_max_temp FLOAT,     -- Average maximum temperature in Celsius
    avg_min_temp FLOAT,     -- Average minimum temperature in Celsius
    total_precipitation FLOAT,  -- Total precipitation in centimeters
    UNIQUE(station_id, year)
);
