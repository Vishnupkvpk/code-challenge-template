To deploy the solution on AWS, we would use the following services:

AWS EC2: EC2 is suitable for smaller applications or when you want more control over your infrastructure.
AWS RDS (PostgreSQL): Store weather data in a scalable, managed PostgreSQL database.
AWS Lambda: Schedule the ingestion script to run periodically using AWS CloudWatch.
AWS S3: Store the weather data files in an S3 bucket and access them from the Lambda function.
AWS CloudWatch: for centralized logging and monitoring of your applicationâ€™s health and performance.
